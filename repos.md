RSL includes support for dynamic replica set reconfiguration, including dynamic growth/srinking of the cluster, and also service-healing (replica replacement). RSL automates the durability of the state (by means of both durable journal files, and periodic snapshots). RSL allows multi-rings per process, allowing a single process to be part of multiple rings at the same time. RSL is implemented in C/C++ and provides a C# wrapper that naturally integrates with C# applications. RSL is widely used in Azure for a large number of infrastructure components, ranging from Azure Fabric Controller, to Azure Storage.

Customers expect the richness of audio and video as part of their solutions, and are increasingly looking to video solutions to deliver new business models and capabilities. Delivering media solutions within existing infrastructure constraints can be very costly. This session will demonstrate how to leverage Azure Media Services for solutions ranging from health and human resources to manufacturing to retail.
https://github.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Modern-Apps | Modern cloud applications offer end-user experiences and features that transcend traditional on-premises applications. For example, there are often multiple database technologies supporting today's modern app. Embrace the notion of polyglot persistence and see how RDBMS's, NoSQL databases, and caches can be combined to deliver robust end-user experiences. Modern cloud apps today are also expected to be reachable regardless of the platform or device. See how Azure's App Service can be used to expand the reach of your solutions. Modern cloud apps are also not always just platform-as-a-service solutions. Learn about modern architecture patterns enabled by Azure that span infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service deployments.
https://github.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Monitoring-and-Diagnostics | Application monitoring and diagnosing problems is a core function of all IT groups, regardless of whether the application is running on-premises or in the cloud. In this session see how IT can leverage features such as Operational Insights to collect, store, and analyze diagnostics data. Next, learn how developers can use Application Insights to provide deep analytical metrics from their applications to improve performance, response times, analyze application failures, and discover usability trends. Lastly, learn practices for storing log data, tools for analysis, and how to configure rules and alerts to help thwart off potential problems for your end-users.
https://github.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Networking | Learn about key Networking concepts in the Azure Platform to create secure and scalabale networked environments, and connections to your on-premises environments.
https://github.com/AzureCAT-GSI/OSS | Microsoft Azure is an open and flexible platform that enables you to run the platform and code that your solution requires. One in 5 virtual machines on the Microsoft Azure platform use Linux, and Microsoft has openly embraced the open source community by contributing key assets such as the .NET framework and its libraries to the open source community. Microsoft is a key contributor to open source initiatives and enables the platform that your solution needs regardless if it uses Windows or not.

https://github.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Secure-Solutions | Raise your hand if you're a security expert! Most would not raise their hands, even if they were a security expert. Today's online world is extremely hostile. So, naturally, questions about security and compliance are front-and-center for all customers. In this session you will learn about steps Microsoft takes to insure a secure and compliant platform for you to architect and build your solutions on. You will learn about the resources available to you to address complex security and compliance questions. Most of all, you will learn that you (and your customer) share in this responsibility of securing your solution. Where does Microsoft's responsibility for security end and where does your responsibility begin? What are some specific actions you can take to promote a secure solution and instill confidence with your customers that their solution is secure? Find out the answers to these questions in this session.
https://github.com/AzureCAT-GSI/SessionCatalog | The repositories managed by Azure CAT GSI provides materials to deliver sessions on various Microsoft Azure solution architecture topics, such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service capabilities, services supporting Internet-of-Things scenarios, Big Data, and many more.

https://github.com/contoso-a/service-explore-test | This is a common component used by plugins for Eclipse, IntelliJ and Android Studio to help the developer sign in and manage their Azure resources within IDE.Functionality supported in the plugin are Authentication, Services Explorer for Azure Mobile Services, Virtual Machines(classic), Storage for Blobs, Tables and Queues.This code was previously open sourced at https://github.com/MSOpenTech/msopentech-tools-for-intellij under Apache License 2.0 .The MS Open Tech Tools contains functionality for Java and Android. Since Java and Android ecosystems have different requirements these tools will evolve differently so MS Open Tech Tools is split into three components.1.Common code  for sign in and Services Explorer called Azure Services Explorer that corresponds to this repository.2.Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ-Java developers who host applications in Azure.3.Microsoft Cloud Services for Android for Android developers who connect their client applications to Azure or Office 365 services.

Since the best way to understand the behavior of Elastic Pools is to experience using them under load, we provide a load generator. The load generator is a console application that targets one or more elastic database instances in an Elastic Pool with a specific write load. You can run multiple instances of the load generator with different settings if you want to create a blended load, e.g., a mix of heavy a light load. In addition, you do not need to target all databases in the pool by the load generator, so you can leave databases you choose without any load.
